# System Commands VM

## Getting started with the VM

- VM assignments at the directory `/opt/se2001/<assignment_name>/`

- Solutions present in directory `~/se2001/<assignment name>/`

- Ran `synchro eval` from the respective assignment directory `~/se2001/<assignment name>/` for evaluation

- Useful packages installed
  - `tmux` a terminal multiplexer useful in splitting the terminal, recover your terminal session even when you disconnected from VM.
  - `batcat` a rust based alternative to `cat` that will display the file contents with colour
